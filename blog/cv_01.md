🖼️ OpenCV Beginner Image Operations – Zoro Image Demo
This notebook demonstrates foundational OpenCV operations using a sample image of Zoro. It walks through reading, displaying, saving, editing, and annotating images using Python's cv2 module.

📁 Contents
Section	Description
1. 📥 Image Reading	Load image as NumPy array using cv2.imread()
2. 🖥️ Image Display	Display image in a window using cv2.imshow()
3. 💾 Image Saving	Save the image to disk using cv2.imwrite()
4. ℹ️ Image Properties	Extract shape info (height, width, channels)
5. 🌈 Color Space Conversion	Convert from BGR to Grayscale
6. 🔍 Image Resizing	Resize the image with custom dimensions
7. 📝 Text Overlay	Add text using cv2.putText()
8. 📏 Drawing Lines	Draw straight lines with coordinates and color
9. 🟢 Drawing Circles	Add circles on the image
10. ◼️ Drawing Rectangles	Draw rectangles using corner coordinates
11. 🥚 Drawing Ellipses	Draw rotated ellipses for highlights
12. 🌑 Grayscale Load	Reload image directly in grayscale
🛠️ Requirements
Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed:

pip install opencv-python
📸 Example Snippet
import cv2
img = cv2.imread('zoro.jpg')
cv2.imshow('Zoro Vice-captain', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
🧠 Key Notes
OpenCV loads images in BGR format by default, not RGB.

cv2.waitKey(0) waits indefinitely for a key event.

Drawing functions include:

cv2.line()
cv2.circle()
cv2.rectangle()
cv2.ellipse()
Text overlay uses cv2.putText() with font, color, and scale control.

Getting Started with Image Processing
This tutorial covers the fundamental building blocks of computer vision with OpenCV. Whether you're new to image processing or looking to refresh your knowledge, these basic operations form the foundation for more advanced computer vision applications.

The examples shown here demonstrate practical, hands-on approaches to working with images in Python, making it perfect for beginners who want to start their computer vision journey.
